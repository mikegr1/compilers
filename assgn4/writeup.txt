1. Michael Griggs & Bryce Townsend, both taking CS4318

2. We will meet November 23rd to discuss implementations, and then call ad hoc meetings as needed until the December 1st due date.

3. Parser, symbol table, and driver were updated by Michael Griggs. In terms of code generation, Bryce Townsend implemented expressions,
   assignments, conditional statments, and the activation record. We both tried to debug.
4. 

	test code:
int q = 3;
int main(){
	int z = 0;
	output(5);
	if(q == 3){
	  z = 4;
	}

	for(int l = 0; l < z; l++){
		if(l < z){
			z = z + z;
		}

		if(z > l){
			z = z - l;
		}
	}
}


5. Known bugs: too many symbol table functions to implement that we did not understand how to do. These functions came from the feedback
		provided to us after assignment 3 had been graded. 

6. we tried to use the stack pointer to denote the start of a function, and a frame pointer to denote its endpoint.
   When the stack pointer reaches the frame pointer, the next function waits at the next memory location after the frame pointer.

7. ideally, you would run the the make file and then use obj/(test file). this would produce a .asm document that would then be 
   loaded into QTspim and then ran. unfortuantely this did not happen.
